# Dotnet SDK for OpenAI ChatGPT, Whisper, GPT-4 and DALL·E
-----------------------------------------------------------
# This library moved to Betalgo.OpenAI [![Betalgo.OpenAI](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Betalgo.OpenAI.GPT3?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Betalgo.OpenAI/)
## This library has been moved to Betalgo.OpenAI. Please use that library instead.
## This ID (Betalgo.OpenAI.GPT3) will no longer be maintained.
## As OpenAI has introduced more tools, the name GPT3 has become confusing.
## Therefore, I have decided to rename the library to Betalgo.OpenAI. Unfortunately, Nuget does not allow the package to be renamed, so a new package has been created instead.

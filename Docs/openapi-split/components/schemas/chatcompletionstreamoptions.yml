              description: "If set, an additional chunk will be streamed before the `data: [DONE]`\nmessage. The `usage` field on this chunk shows the token usage statistics\nfor the entire request, and the `choices` field will always be an empty\narray.\n\nAll other chunks will also include a `usage` field, but with a null\nvalue. **NOTE:** If the stream is interrupted, you may not receive the\nfinal usage chunk which contains the total token usage for the request.\n"

              type: boolean
              description: "When true, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds\nrandom characters to an `obfuscation` field on streaming delta events to\nnormalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel attacks.\nThese obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a small amount\nof overhead to the data stream. You can set `include_obfuscation` to\nfalse to optimize for bandwidth if you trust the network links between\nyour application and the OpenAI API.\n"
          description: "Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.\n"

Reducing\nreasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used\non reasoning in a response.\n\n- `gpt-5.1` defaults to `none`, which does not perform reasoning. The supported reasoning values for `gpt-5.1` are `none`, `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Tool calls are supported for all reasoning values in gpt-5.1.\n- All models before `gpt-5.1` default to `medium` reasoning effort, and do not support `none`.\n- The `gpt-5-pro` model defaults to (and only supports) `high` reasoning effort.\n"

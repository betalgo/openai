              description: "When true, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds\nrandom characters to an `obfuscation` field on streaming delta events to\nnormalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel attacks.\nThese obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a small amount\nof overhead to the data stream. You can set `include_obfuscation` to\nfalse to optimize for bandwidth if you trust the network links between\nyour application and the OpenAI API.\n"

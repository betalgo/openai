There are several scenarios that produce this event:\n  - The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce \n    either one or two Items, which will be of type `message` \n    (role `assistant`) or type `function_call`.\n  - The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the \n    server (in `server_vad` mode). The server will take the content of the \n    input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.\n  - The client has sent a `conversation.item.create` event to add a new Item \n    to the Conversation.\n"

      description: "Sent by the server when in `server_vad` mode to indicate that speech has been \ndetected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the \nbuffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this \nevent to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user. \n\nThe client should expect to receive a `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event \nwhen speech stops. The `item_id` property is the ID of the user message item \nthat will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the \n`input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event (unless the client manually commits \nthe audio buffer during VAD activation).\n"

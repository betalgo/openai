      description: "An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You\ncan specify which tool to use by setting the `tool_choice` parameter.\n\nWe support the following categories of tools:\n- **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the\n  model's capabilities, like [web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search)\n  or [file search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search). Learn more about\n  [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools).\n- **MCP Tools**: Integrations with third-party systems via custom MCP servers\n  or predefined connectors such as Google Drive and SharePoint. Learn more about\n  [MCP Tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).\n- **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you,\n  enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments\n  and outputs. Learn more about\n  [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). You can also use\n  custom tools to call your own code.\n"
